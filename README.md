Bowie Shoreline is for the [Robot Missions](http://robotmissions.org) introductory robot platform, _Bowie_, as applied to Mission #1: Shoreline Cleanup. This contains behaviours that use the core modules in the Bowie Library.

### More information about our robot platform at the [Robot Missions Website ‚ûû](http://robotmissions.org)

Compatible with the Robot Missions Brain Board, using either a [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html) for full functionality (Mega), or a [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) (Mini).

| **Operator ID** | `$` | `X` | `1` | `OPERATOR_ID` from `0` to `255` |


**Output: Robot to Operator**

| Description | Action specifier | Command | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Motor Current Sensor** | `#` | `E` | `1` | Current sensor reading of type `uint16_t` |
| **Servo Current Sensor** | `#` | `F` | `1` | Current sensor reading of type `uint16_t` |
| **Robot ID** | `$` | `W` | `1` | `ROBOT_ID` from `0` to `255` |
| **Reserved for testing** | `@` | `Z` | `0` | `0` |

If your robot running Mission #1 needs more functionality, feel free to add new API commands. For example, one could add an API command for an output of the IMU.
